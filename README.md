# Game | Soul Eater

Welcome to Soul Eater!
Imagine you are a demon worm in a hell dungeon fullfilling your daily work of snatching cute little souls...

This is my metal adaption of the game classic Snake. It is my very first project in which I created a simple Snake game that fits my needs for dark yet cute old school games.
I used HTML5, canvas, JS, jquery, CSS3 & Photoshop.
